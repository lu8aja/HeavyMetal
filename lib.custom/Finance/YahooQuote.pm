Finance::YahooQuote - Get stock quotes from Yahoo! Finance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Finance::YahooQuote;
  # setting TIMEOUT and PROXY is optional
  $Finance::YahooQuote::TIMEOUT = 60;
  $Finance::YahooQuote::PROXY = "http://some.where.net:8080";
  @quote = getonequote $symbol;	# Get a quote for a single symbol
  @quotes = getquote @symbols;	# Get quotes for a bunch of symbols
  useExtendedQueryFormat();     # switch to extended query format
  useRealtimeQueryFormat();     # switch to real-time query format
  @quotes = getquote @symbols;	# Get quotes for a bunch of symbols
  @quotes = getcustomquote(["DELL","IBM"], # using custom format
			   ["Name","Book Value"]); # note array refs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module gets stock quotes from Yahoo! Finance.  The B<getonequote>
function will return a quote for a single stock symbol, while the
B<getquote> function will return a quote for each of the stock symbols
passed to it.  B<getcustomquote> allows to specify a format other than
the default to take advantage of the extended range of available information.

The download operation is efficient: only one request is made even if
several symbols are requested at once. The return value of
B<getonequote> is an array, with the following elements:

    0 Symbol
    1 Company Name
    2 Last Price
    3 Last Trade Date
    4 Last Trade Time
    5 Change
    6 Percent Change
    7 Volume
    8 Average Daily Vol
    9 Bid
    10 Ask
    11 Previous Close
    12 Today's Open
    13 Day's Range
    14 52-Week Range
    15 Earnings per Share
    16 P/E Ratio
    17 Dividend Pay Date
    18 Dividend per Share
    19 Dividend Yield
    20 Market Capitalization
    21 Stock Exchange

If the extended format has been selected, the following fields are also
retrieved:

    22 Short ratio
    23 1yr Target Price
    24 EPS Est. Current Yr
    25 EPS Est. Next Year
    26 EPS Est. Next Quarter
    27 Price/EPS Est. Current Yr
    28 Price/EPS Est. Next Yr
    29 PEG Ratio
    30 Book Value
    31 Price/Book
    32 Price/Sales
    33 EBITDA
    34 50-day Moving Avg
    35 200-day Moving Avg

If the real-time format has been selected, the following fields are also
retrieved:

    36 Ask (real-time)
    37 Bid (real-time)
    38 Change in Percent (real-time)
    39 Last trade with time (real-time)
    40 Change (real-time)
    41 Day range (real-time)
    42 Market-cap (real-time)

The B<getquote> function returns an array of pointers to arrays with
the above structure.

The B<getonequote> function returns just one quote, rather than an array. It returns a simple array of values for the given symbol.

The B<setQueryString> permits to supply a new query string that will
be used for subsequent data requests.

The B<useExtendedQueryFormat> and B<useRealtimeQueryFormat> are
simpler interfaces which append symbols to the default quote string,
as detailed above.

The B<getcustomquote> returns an array of quotes corresponding to
values for the symbols supplied in the first array reference, and the
custom fields supplied in the second array reference. Here the custom
fields correspond to the 'named' fields of the list below.

Beyond stock quotes, B<Finance::YahooQuote> can also obtain quotes for
currencies (from the Philadephia exchange -- however Yahoo! appears to
have stopped to support the currency symbols in a reliable manner), US
mutual funds, options on US stocks, several precious metals and quite
possibly more; see the Yahoo! Finance website for full
information. B<Finance::YahooQuote> can be used for stocks from the
USA, Canada, various European exchanges, various Asian exchanges
(Singapore, Taiwan, HongKong, Kuala Lumpur, ...) Australia and New
Zealand. It should work for other markets supported by Yahoo.

You may optionally override the default LWP timeout of 180 seconds by setting
$Finance::YahooQuote::TIMEOUT to your preferred value.

You may also provide a proxy (for the required http connection) by using
the variable $Finance::YahooQuote::PROXY. Furthermore, authentication-based 
proxies can be used by setting the proxy user and password via the variables
$Finance::YahooQuote::PROXYUSER and $Finance::YahooQuote::PROXYPASSWD.

Two example scripts are provided to help with the mapping a stock
symbols as well as with Yahoo! Finance server codes. The regression
tests scripts in the B<t/> subdirectory of the source distribution
also contain simple examples.

=head1 FAQs

=head2 How can one figure out the format string?  

Provided a My Yahoo! (http://my.yahoo.com) account, go to the
following URL:

    http://edit.my.yahoo.com/config/edit_pfview?.vk=v1

Viewing the source of this page, you will come across the section that
defines the menus that let you select which elements go into a
particular view.  The <option> values are the strings that pick up
the information described in the menu item.  For example, Symbol
refers to the string "s" and name refers to the string "l".  Using
"sl" as the format string, we would get the symbol followed by the
name of the security.

The example script I<examine_server.sh> shows this in some more detail
and downloads example .csv files using B<GNU wget>.

=head2 What about different stock symbols for the same corporation?

This can be issue. For the first few years, Yahoo! Finance's servers 
appeared to be cover their respective local markets. E.g., the UK-based 
servers provided quotes for Europe, the Australian one for the Australia
and New Zealand and so on.  Hence, one needed to branch and bound code
and map symbols to their region's servers.

It now appears that this is no longer required, which is good news as it 
simplifies coding. However, some old symbols are no longer supported --
yet other, and supported, codes exist for the same company.  For example,
German stocks used to quoted in terms or their cusip-like 'WKN'. The
main server does not support these, but does support newer, acronym-based
symbols.  The example script examine_server.sh helps in finding the mapping
as e.g. from 555750.F to DTEGN.F for Deutsche Telekom.
